// IDEA: RAFIKI - A community currency for shared appartments

// use case definition and vote on price (i.e. X amount of the currency):
e.g. 
  - do the laundry
  - take the garbage out
  - fill the dishwasher
  - ...

// Economic incentives to trade currency: 3% interest per month on current holdings


// Example workflow:
1. User create profile by providing basic incredentials (name, email, ...)
2. New user profile gets validated by network participants
3. Permitted users can define new use cases to be put for a vote on the price
4. ...
